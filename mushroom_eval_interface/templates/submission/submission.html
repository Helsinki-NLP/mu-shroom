<strong>Submissions for this competition are closed!</strong> Thanks for your interest nonetheless. <br>
If we haven't done so, we will release the labeled test data shortly, along with the code for this interface. 
In the meantime, you can go have a look at the official rankings on the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">landing page</a>.
